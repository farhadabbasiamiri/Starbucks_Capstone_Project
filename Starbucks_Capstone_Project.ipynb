    "# Starbucks Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    " \n",
    "This capstone project is using data provided by Udacity as part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree course. It contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. The provided background information on the mobile app is that once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks, and not all users receive the same offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use machine learning classification models to uncover the feature importances to identify the drivers of offer effectiveness, while exploring if the model itself could be used to predict if a user would take up an offer. In addition, I explore the characteristics of users who do or do not take up an offer. For instance, a user could receive a BOGO (buy one get one free) offer on Monday. The offer is valid for 7 days from receipt. If the customer buys a product during the validity period, the customer completes the offer. However, there are a few things to watch out for in these datasets. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the BOGO offer, but the user never opens the offer during the 7 day validity period. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main questions that I try to answer in this capstone project as follow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the main drivers of an effective offer on the Starbucks app? \n",
    "2. Could the data provided, namely offer characteristics and user demographics, predict whether a user would take up an offer?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three datasets provided in this project:\n",
    "- portfolio.json: Containing the attributes of each offer (duration, type, etc.)\n",
    "- profile.json: Demographic data for each customer\n",
    "- transcript.json: Records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This datasets are the simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification models\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data provided, I answer the main questions using three supervised classification machine learning models, feeding in the data from three different offer types. Using this way, the model can predict whether the offer will be responded by the customers or not when sent to them. Also, by checking the feature importance of the model, we can answer the question that what factors are main for an offer to be effective. The classification models used in this projects are \"decision tree classifier\", \"random forest classifier\", and \"regression model\"."

The objective of offers are to drive purchases, so it would already be the case that users with high spend in their transactions would be flagged as effective_offers.\n",

However, for those transctions where offer_completed=0, I have not considered them, and this could be a potential feature to include, as a proxy for the 'baseline' level of spending for a user.\n",

    "The logic is to wonder if there is some baseline level of spending for users who are highly influenced by certain offers (in group 1), and group 2, and if there is some predictive power in this baseline level of 'invalid transactions' that can predict the propensity of a user to take up an offer."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I found this project challenging, mainly due to the structure of the data in the `transcript` dataset. I had started out with 2 business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the main features influencing the effectiveness of an offer on the Starbucks app?\n",
    "2. Could the data provided, namely offer characteristics and user demographics, predict whether a user would take up an offer?\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Question 1 findings:\n",
    "For Question 1, the feature importance given by all 3 models were that the tenure of a member is the biggest predictor of the effectiveness of an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all three models, the top 3 variables were the same - membership tenure, income and age. However, income and age switched orders depending on offer type. \n",
    "\n",
    "For BOGO and discount offers, the distribution of feature importances were relatively equal. However, for informational offers, the distribution is slightly more balanced, with income the second most important variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Question 2 findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "My decision to use 3 separate models to predict the effectiveness of each offer type ended up with good accuracy for the BOGO and discount models (82.87% for BOGO and 87.38% for discount), while slightly less accurate performance for informational offers (75.23%). However, I would regard 75% as acceptable in a business setting, as for informational offers, there is no cost involved to inform users of a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, for BOGO and discount models, I am quite happy with the 80% and above accuracy, as in a business setting that would be acceptable to show offers to people, even if the model misclassifies a few, the overall revenue increase might justify the few mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Main challenges and potential improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "When analysing and building the machine learning models to answer the above questions, reflections on my main challenges and findings are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Attribution framework for assigning offer_ids for transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer Question 1, I had to first define what an 'effective offer' means using the transactional records. This proved to be the trickiest portion of the project. I had to define a funnel for what what an effective conversion would look like, as we had data on both effective and noneffective conversions. Thus, I was desigining an attribution model for the conversion events (`offer completed` and `transaction` events) based on the events that occurred prior for each person.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up having to separate the users into 4 different pools, based on their actions in the transcript data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Group 1: People who are influenced by offers and thus purchase/complete the offer(successful/effective conversion of offer)\n",
    "- Group 2: People who receive and an offer but is not influenced and thus no conversion event (ineffective conversion of offer)\n",
    "- Group 3: People who have conversion events but was not actually influenced by an offer\n",
    "- Group 4: People who receive offers but no views or action taken\n",

    "Even after separating the groups, it was challenging to assign the people in group 3 based on the transactional data. I had to define the event space where the right sequence of events would occur before I could assign an offer id to transactions (which did not have an offer_id), essentally designing a event/sequence-based attribution window.\n",

    "Deciding on what features to re-engineer and how to engineer for an effective model. At the end, our reengineered feature of membership tenure was indeed the most important feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "I had made the decision to build 3 separate models depending on offer types based on my definition of the problem statement - as I wanted to discover what would drive an effective offer, I thought it made more sense to remove noise from the data by separating the data into the offer types. My decision ended up to be quite a good one as the single BOGO and discount models got good performance in testing scores. \n",

    "For the info model, the accuracy was slightly worse as we had less records overall. As elaborated above, I believe that if we had more data, I could have gotten the accuracy higher.\n",

    "An additional note on model selection - I selected tree-based models as I wanted to assess feature importance, but I could have extended this study further by testing a parametric/ regression model (e.g. logistic regression for classification tasks). The weights of the coefficients from a regression model might have been interesting to contrast with the feature importance of a tree-based model, given that both models have different ways of analysing the data. The feature `membership_tenure_days` might not have been the highest weighted feature, in contrast to how it was in this study.\n",

    "Due to time reasons, I couldn't get a chance to try some other enhancement in the step of model tuning. For example, probably, I can do some more experiment on feature engineering step to see if any other new features can improve the model, also I could also try to reduce some feature to see how it will affect the model performance.\n",

    "Also, so far the analysis is focused more on customer's who successfully finish the transaction after they received the offer, there should be more insight for the other cases where the customer finishes the transactions regardless of the offer. If we could get any insight into those cases, maybe we can send out more offers to those customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I was thinking if I could do some unsupervised learning on clustering the customers based on information we are given, to see if there are any specific characteristics on a group of customers who will be more likely to respond to the offer."
